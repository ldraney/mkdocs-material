# It's useful to recognize that this workflow is designed to be triggered by a merge to the default branch.
# Therefore, ${{ github.sha }} will always be in reference to the SHA that originally triggered this workflow.
# $GITHUB_SHA, on the other hand, is created whenever actions/checkout@v4 is run

# note:
# environment:

# is keyword for using the environment protections.

# with:
  # environment:
# is simply using a variable named environment
